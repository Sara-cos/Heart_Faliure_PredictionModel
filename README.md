# Heart_Faliure_PredictionModel

## Dataset
The Cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of death globally taking an estimation 17.9 million lives per year and consist of around 31% of annual deaths. The CVD in population is caused due to various factors. In CVD, heart failure is a common event and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

The dataset contains data based on these attributes:-
1. age
2. anaemia [decreased red blood cell]
3. creatinine phosphorus [Level of CPK enszyme in the blood]
4. diabetes 
5. ejection fraction [Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction]
6. high blood preassure
7. platelets
8. serum creatinine
9. serum sodium
10. sex
